description: >
  James Sunderland has arrived in the town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his wife,
  Mary, despite that she had died from an illness three years ago.
  The letter states that Mary is waiting for James in their "special place,"
  but this confuses James as the whole town of Silent Hill was their special place.
