description: >
  The plot begins with the animals overthrowing their oppressive farmer and
  creating their own governance system, aiming for a utopia where all animals
  are equal. However, as leadership emerges among them, the ideals of the
  revolution are gradually undermined. Through its fable-like narrative,
  the book examines how power can corrupt and how systems meant to promote
  fairness can become tools of exploitation.
